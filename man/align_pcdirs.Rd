List with the same structure as `prep_training_data`, but
the principal directions are replaced with the aligned version and gamI is
included in the fpca_res object.

\description{
The function 'prep_training_data' does not center the warping functions,
which leads to issues when visualizing joint and horizontal principal
component directions. This function aligns the principal directions for
improved interpretability of the principal directions. Currently, only
alignment for jfPCA has been implemented.
