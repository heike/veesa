\title{Compute permutation feature importance (PFI)}
\usage{
compute_pfi(x, y, f, K, metric, eps = 1e-15)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Dataset with n observations and p variables (training or testing)}

\item{y}{Response variable (or matrix) associated with x}

\item{f}{Model to explain}

\item{K}{Number of repetitions to perform for PFI}

\item{metric}{Metric used to compute PFI (choose from "accuracy", "logloss", and "nmse")}

\item{eps}{Log loss is undefined for p = 0 or p = 1, so probabilities are}

\description{
Function for computing PFI for a given model and dataset (training or testing)
