#' Obtain PC directions with centered warping functions
#'
#' The function 'prep_training_data' does not center the warping functions,
#' which leads to issues when visualizing joint and horizontal principal 
#' component directions. This function aligns the principal directions for 
#' improved interpretability of the principal directions. Currently, only
#' alignment for jfPCA has been implemented.
#'
#' @param train_obj Output object from `prep_training_data` (jfpca only)
#'
#' @export align_pcdirs
#'
#' @return List with the same structure as `prep_training_data`, but 
#' the principal directions are replaced with the aligned version and gamI is
#' included in the fpca_res object.
