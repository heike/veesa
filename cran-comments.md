## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Adjusted the arXiv reference for technical details in the Description field 
  to the recommended format (<doi:10.48550/arXiv.YYMM.NNNNN> instead of 
  <arXiv:YYMM.NNNNN>).
  
* Dealt with Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    VEESA (9:29)
    al (14:52)
    et (14:49)
    vertial (12:3)
  Replaced VEESA with the spelled out version of the pipeline (Variable 
  importance Explainable Elastic Shape Analysis).
  Added '.' after al to be grammatically correct.
  et all is okay as is.
  Added the missing 'c' to vertical.
